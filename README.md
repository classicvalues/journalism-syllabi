# Computer-Assisted Reporting and Data Journalism Syllabuses

This is a collection of computational and data journalism courses for which there is a __publicly available homepage or syllabus__ suitable for others to use as a guiding reference, i.e. basically anything that shows up in a Google search for `syllabus` + `computational`/`data`/`research` + `journalism` / `computer assisted reporting`.

Data/computational journalism is still a relatively new field, so it can be hard to know what's possible to fit in a curriculum. Hopefully, the 230+ course syllabuses – and in many cases, open source code/data repos – listed here can provide  helpful guidance! 

**Jump [to the list of 230+ courses](#the-course-list)**

-------------

## Background info

This list includes courses from as early as 1997 and several taught in countries not in North America. I started compiling this list before [teaching at Stanford](http://cjlab.stanford.edu/) in 2014. In June 2016, I uploaded it here and made a few updates, but it's not complete or consistent by any means. It includes a few not-really computational/journalism courses, which I may trim later, and misses anything not found via Google or from the top of my head. 

The [list of courses](#the-course-list) – which is at the end of this README file – is generated from a YAML file that you can see in its raw glory here: [some-syllabi.yaml](some-syllabi.yaml)
